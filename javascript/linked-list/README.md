# Singly Linked List

*A linked list is a linear collection of data components whose linear order is determined by their physical placement in memory rather than by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element serves as a pointer to the next. It is a data structure made up of a collection of nodes that represent a sequence. In its most basic form, each node is made up of data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.*

## Challenge
*Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.and Create a Linked List class.*

## Challenge 6 

*add to the linked list three methode*
1. append, take one argument
2. insert before,take two arguments
3. insert after,take two arguments

## Challenge 7

*add to the linked list kth from end function*

## Challenge 8

*add zip-List that Zip two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the the zipped list.*



## Approach & Efficiency

**Time Complexity:** 

1. *Access O(n)*
2. *Insertion O(1)*

**space Complexity:** 

*O(n)*

## API
 *in my code there are my linked list methods:*

 1. *insert: Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.*
 2. *includes: Indicates whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.*

 3. *to string: Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List,*

 4. *append: adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list*

 5. *insert before: adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified*

 6. *insert after: adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified*

7. *kthFromEnd(k):Return the node’s value that is k places from the tail of the linked list.*
  
8. *kthFromthemiddle: return when k is not at the end, but somewhere in the middle of the linked list* 

9. *zip-List: that Zip two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the the zipped list.*
